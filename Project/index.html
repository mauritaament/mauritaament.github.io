                        This article discussed the difficulties of experience design when dealing with replicating technology for anything dealing with nature. This includes replicating human DNA to plants and everything in between. However, there have been great accomplishments in this area. It used to cost $3 billion in 2000 to sequence a human genome an now it’s less than $1,000. With the cost of sequencing the human genome going down, and customized products for individuals, the greatest feat is that there are now personalized therapies to help people overcome diseases.

                <h5>Released: September 5th, 2013</h5>
                <br>
                This article explains the need & successful accomplishments of using cloud computing with biology to help create the biocloud. The biocloud is used to collect, analyze, and present biodata depending on the project. Projects that use the biocloud range from cloud-based biocomputing to genomics & drug design on the cloud. According to the research paper, “Biomedical cloud, given the proper architecture, could integrate all the petabytes of available biomedical informatics data in one place and process them on a continuous basis. In this way, we would continuously observe the connections between genotypic profiles and phenotypic data. We can envision that the cloud-supported translational bioinformatics endeavours will promote faster breakthroughs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of human disease.” The previous quote is significant because of the amount of information that is being stored and processed in the cloud that could potentially save millions of lives. The cloud enables the user to have low costs while storing a lot of information. It allows the user to focus on their research and make a change that could positively impact the world without having to worry about high costs that could come with a data center.

                    This article explained how Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is changing lives for patients who suffer from complete paralysis. According to the article, “Patients suffering from complete paralysis, but with preserved awareness, cognition, and eye movements and blinking are classified as having locked-in syndrome. If eye movements are also lost, the condition is referred to as completely locked-in syndrome.” It was thought that people who suffered from it couldn’t communicate because they had lost motor control. With a non-invasive BCI software that measure blood levels that equate to “yes” or “no” it has been discovered that these patients can communicate.

                This article explained how some programmers are trying to take a different approach to how they code their software. Instead of writing code as sequential steps, where the next line is dependent on the previous lines, they are creating programs where code is independent of previous lines. This way if a bug were to cause havoc it wouldn’t destroy the entire program but only a piece of the program. If it corrupts that piece the program is able to revert it back to an older configuration so it can continue working normally. This is what they call the program being able to self-heal. It doesn’t require any assistance from the programmer, it is coded to automatically do it.

                This article explains the limitations faced with 3D printing when it comes to creating soft protein and polysaccharide hydrogels for medical software devices. As it currently stands the materials used for additive 3D printing don’t support the flexibility that is needed for these components. These components are important because they are fundamental to creating tissues for humans.
